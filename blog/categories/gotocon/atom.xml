    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just attended Edward Thomson&rsquo;s talk <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2015/presentation/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Git">&ldquo;Deep Dive into Git&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>I find version control and especially git&rsquo;s approach to version control especially interesting because because it is such a good examples of a hacker power tool that would add tremendous value if applied to other trades, like contract drafting.</p>

<p>Edward works on Microsoft&rsquo;s reimplementation of git <a href="https://libgit2.github.com/">libgit2</a>. Apparently the original git has certain issues when used as a library (especially in Visual Studio)</p>

<p>git is essentially distributed and branching is cheap and easy, which Edward demonstrated convincingly. But the higlight of the talk for me was Edward&rsquo;s explanation of the dreaded &ldquo;rebase&rdquo; command. Edward succeeded where a others have failed misrably in explaning rebase in a way that actually makes sense &ndash; at least to me. Instead of merging rebase generates a set of diffs between the most recent ancestor of your present branch and the ancestor. Theses diffs are then applied to the branch your are rebasing to. When I realised <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/getting-started/rewriting-history/02.svg">this image</a> from the Atlassian git tutorial actually made sense to me.</p>

<p>Related to git but not Edwards talk I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/ryuslash/git-auto-commit-mode">git auto commit mode</a> for Emacs. I don&rsquo;t think this would work for code, but I plan to try it out for the prose writing I do in Emacs.</p>

<p>Full Disclosure:  I am receiving a free GOTO ticket from the producers in exchange for blogging about the conference.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I wrote previuously I am going to the <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2015">goto cph conference</a> this year.</p>

<p>One speaker that I am definitively will go see is <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2015/presentation/The%20State%20of%20Data%203">Dave Thomas</a>. Besides being consistently entertaining Dave Thomas also has the experience required to reach into the great work of Computer Science past and show how it remains relevant the practical business challenges of today.</p>

<p>Dave&rsquo;s company has a product called <a href="http://www.bedarra.com/product_overview.html">Ivy</a>. It is a analytics product based on the programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)">Q</a> &ndash; a decendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">APL</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)">K</a> &ndash; and the <a href="http://kx.com/software.php">KDb+</a> database.</p>

<p>Ivy&rsquo;s primary usecase appears to be financial analytics, an area I know little about, but I find its approach to user interface fascinating. It shows how you can precent a contemporary web based GUI using familiar metaphors and maintain the ability to drop down to code when you need to.</p>

<p>Ivy has a very cool modern looking in-browser inteface with spreadsheet like overview of the massive volumes of data the system is designed to handle, a visual query builder and supports a wide range of visualizations. But it also has strong support for the Q language, including a debugger.</p>

<p>I hope to be able to chat with Dave about his thoughts on DSLs and GUIs during the conference and get his take on questions like &ldquo;When do you want both?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What kind of IDE do you need if you want to support non-programmers programming?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Are projectional editors the future of DSLs?&rdquo; etc. and report here on the conversation.</p>
