    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just attended Edward Thomson&rsquo;s talk <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2015/presentation/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Git">&ldquo;Deep Dive into Git&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>I find version control and especially git&rsquo;s approach to version control especially interesting because because it is such a good examples of a hacker power tool that would add tremendous value if applied to other trades, like contract drafting.</p>

<p>Edward works on Microsoft&rsquo;s reimplementation of git <a href="https://libgit2.github.com/">libgit2</a>. Apparently the original git has certain issues when used as a library (especially in Visual Studio)</p>

<p>git is essentially distributed and branching is cheap and easy, which Edward demonstrated convincingly. But the higlight of the talk for me was Edward&rsquo;s explanation of the dreaded &ldquo;rebase&rdquo; command. Edward succeeded where a others have failed misrably in explaning rebase in a way that actually makes sense &ndash; at least to me. Instead of merging rebase generates a set of diffs between the most recent ancestor of your present branch and the ancestor. Theses diffs are then applied to the branch your are rebasing to. When I realised <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/images/tutorials/getting-started/rewriting-history/02.svg">this image</a> from the Atlassian git tutorial actually made sense to me.</p>

<p>Related to git but not Edwards talk I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/ryuslash/git-auto-commit-mode">git auto commit mode</a> for Emacs. I don&rsquo;t think this would work for code, but I plan to try it out for the prose writing I do in Emacs.</p>

<p>Full Disclosure:  I am receiving a free GOTO ticket from the producers in exchange for blogging about the conference.</p>
