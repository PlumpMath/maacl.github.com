Zed writes the following in his work-in-progress book on programming in Python:

> Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but if you want to make about thesame money and be happier you could actually just go run a fast food joint. You are much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.
> 
> People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.

I am not sure that even Zed realizes how profound a truth the above is.
