Looks like I will be at [goto CPH](http://gotocon.com/cph-2014/) again this year.

The format this year is quite different, but looks very interesting nonetheless. Especially the Leading & Bleeding Edge trakc looks interesting. At this track I am especially looking forward to seeing [David Nolen's](http://gotocon.com/cph-2014/speaker/David+Nolen) talk [Putting the Dream Machine to Work](http://gotocon.com/cph-2014/presentation/Immutability:%20Putting%20The%20Dream%20Machine%20To%20Work).

David has created a [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) framework on top of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) called [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om). Om is not just a wrapper around React. It leverages ClojureScript's immutable datastructures to substitute costly object and array compares with reference equality checks. This results in quite significant [performance improvements](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/12/17/the-future-of-javascript-mvcs/).

David in his [tutorials](https://github.com/swannodette/om/wiki/Basic-Tutorial#intercomponent-communication) encourage another ClojureScript feature [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) for intercomponent communication.

As Om is still very new there are not many presentations available but [Functional UI programming with React.JS and ClojureScript](https://vimeo.com/97516219) is a very good introduction.

If you understand Norwegian (and maybe even if you don't) [Magnar Sveen](https://github.com/magnars) and [Christian Johansen](https://github.com/cjohansen) have recorded a very entertaining series of pair programming screencast where they use ClojureScript, [Quiescent](https://github.com/levand/quiescent) (an alternative React ClojureScript library) and a TDD approach to create a Zombie themed Memory Flash Game called [ZOMBIECLJ](http://www.zombieclj.no/)
